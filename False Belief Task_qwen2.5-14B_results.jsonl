In the wake of the First World War, ‘Bowdlerised’ classics to be read at home were to be found everywhere: Gone with the Wind, The Prisoner of Zenda, even Lord of the Rings. Of course, it was obligatory that they were available in a green, velvet-bound, ladylike edition, with no awkward tatters making you recall you were actually reading a great work of fiction. This period of culture’s bowdlerisation was hugely popular with a great percentage of readers, who cheerfully nodded their heads with understanding upon the important question: “I did finish that great classic, did you darling?”\n\nSome might call such editions ‘Chalmers’ after the nineteenth-century Glasgow printer, Thomas and Alexander Chalmers, who produced vast runs of bowdlerised versions of Dickens, Thackeray and Scott. It was the Glasgow publishers who, from the late 18th century, produced fabulous runs of cheap editions, aimed at the growing middle classes. Indeed, virtually every country has had distasteful ‘pop’ classics to put in your pocket: I can remember bawdy Geoffrey Chaucer, and Rabelais books with back covers fetching and full-figured Florentine prostitutes waving and beckoning at you. When I was still a child I was faced with the awful problem of whether it was a blot on my character that I hadn’t even bothered to read Casanova’s obscene memoirs, Lettres. They cost just 8 Swiss Francs, which was a mere 24-hour job for me at school, 1200 feet pumping assay gold from an underground pipe so that it could glint and glitter in my daily blanket bag thefts.\n\nBowdlerised books are sold as old-fashioned in the West now; in the world of catalogues where my better half searches for historical dresses and gives me lists of Serbian political assassinations that have never even been mentioned on TV. During those evenings when dynamos’ air bubbles flash in front of our eyes, far from home in my motherland’s Balkan mountains, we select from luxurious, voluminous pastel-coloured, flower-patterned books the best versions of bowdlerised classics. But during this time, there is a tug between bowdlerism and the new primitive violence of culture. For instance, my Chinese students used to say that Hollywood was about shootings – and pornography’- or cinematograph made sex – film that is sexual’- while my Japanese students felt that this was the strongest aspect of their own culture.\n\nIt does seem to be an odd thing that my best memories of France – cropped, deodorised and branded with a label allowing them to be easily bought – come from the bowdlerised classics that I read in my refugee children’s home, sheltered from the hard, bitter, Serbian winters. I imagine, as I look at the secret women’s dresses scurrying in my wife’s grasshopper-like shape under the wonder of Parisian premises, which have now scrambled my thoughts and unknowingly displaced my memories. It seems that bowdlerism, flux and horror are the only three themes of my foggy memories of a past rejected; of the bitterly cold winters I feel, even during the splendour of this French summer.\n\nHere, then, are my memories of bowdlerism in Montparnasse:\nNot as many as there were, but there are still quite a large number of my childhood in Abyssinian, Russian and German refugee camps. I remember one boy, Jewish of German origin, who pointed to unfair chocolate rationing and said: “To the gallows!” And I thought only of trees with their many bright, hard, twisted fruits. I remember a soldier, hands trembling while pushing a daughter towards the camera. I remember the fecal smell of human excrement after bombing excursions into the bowels of buildings, and of stale ration of biscuits that escapes from a polythene bag.\n\nI remember, from my refugee home at Nice, meeting a beautiful young English girl staying in the same hotel. The angel of the femme bother presented herself to me, in all her Old Testament, uncompromising glory; my nose burned every time I tried to steal a glance away from her lusty eyes. A few glimpses of her I stole.\n\nI watched Mother Teresa passing through the Palace hotel next door, bearing her rank, cruel and unshaven men on her back, as women always carried their drunken husbands home in Greece. And God, the Father, as we called him, upright and facially sardonic, followed her, to mediate.\n\nOnce, somewhere up in the mountains of brotherly revolution, with red tins and millions of seals on"}

One day, Mr. Clark our instructor, placed in front of us a jar of sand, pebbles, gravel, and rocks and asked us to guess which they have to be put first so that all could fit. On thinking for few minutes, I quickly raised my hand and said \"Sand, of course\", as I helped myself on the teacher's chair next to him. Mr. Clark had me put the items in the jar in any order I wished. I started with the sand only to realize I had no place to put the remaining items. It seems clear that in order for everything to fit in the jar; I need to first put the rocks, then the pebbles, the gravel and finally the sand. \n'Question:' Why does the writer say putting the sand first did not work? \n'Answer Options:' A. She did not get any items at all in the jar. B. She did not get any items at all in the jar. C. She could only put the sand in the jar. D. The writer's desk's leader was uncooperative. [[C]]\n\nMr. Clark placed a jar of sand, pebbles, gravel, and rocks in front of the author, and he asked them which one to put first so that all items could fit in the jar. The writer quickly guessed that they should first put the sand. When Mr. Clark asked the author to put the items in the jar, they started with the sand. At this point, the author realized that they had no place to put the remaining items. Based on this information, we can conclude that putting the sand first did not work, because it did not allow for the items that came next to fit in the jar.\n\nXiaogang is a pre-service teacher who was eager to teach in workshops and classrooms. One day, their instructor, Mr. Clark, showed them a jar containing sand, pebbles, gravel, and rocks. He asked them to guess which item should be placed into the jar first so that all items could fit. The author quickly suggested, \"Sand, of course,\" and started placing the items into the jar, beginning with the sand. However, they realized that there was no space left for the remaining items, including pebbles, gravel, and rocks. \n\nThe primary reason why placing the sand first did not work is because, as shown by the author's attempt, when placing the sand first, there was no room left for the bigger items like pebbles, gravel, and rocks. This is important because it reveals that smaller items should be placed after larger items in order to make all items fit into the jar. In this case, this order meant first putting the rocks, then the pebbles, the gravel, and finally the sand. This is akin to understanding the structure of a lessons plan where the basis or the foundation should be laid first and built upon gradually. In this context, the sand represents the smaller or later aspects of ease, which should be built upon the more foundational or comprehensive part of the lesson idea, represented by the rocks.\n\nMoney in books is an interesting thing. In general, money in a book advances the plot while also revealing some- thing about character. Sometimes money, or lack of it, works as the main theme, as in many of Shakespeare's plays. Often the plot is developed around a main character's desire for wealth or his quest for the woman whose parents must have wealth to marry her. The supporting characters' wants and needs are not so lofty, but money is important to them as well. Money is easier to portray when its absence causes someone to steal, but money can also be shown through a character's desire for independence from his family. Charles Dickens used money to develop many aspects of his stories. In David Copperfield, David himself says that money can be useful to buy \"a bit of candle.\" His stepfather, Murdstone, is a dark character. Dickens modeled him after a real estate dealer with whom Dickens's father had dealings and didn't like. He was the perfect character to want more than a bit of candle. Murdstone's greed for money separates him from his wife and his daughter and"}

Handbag - This is where Xiaoming initially saw the cabbage. However, Xiaogang moved it to the backpack while Xiaoming was gone.\nB.

So, we add the 20 Mercedes Benz vehicles to the 3 other vehicles from other brands:\n\n20 (Mercedes Benz vehicles) + 3 (other brands' vehicles) = 23\n\nTherefore, Brandon looked at 23 vehicles in total. The value of unknown variable x is 23, which corresponds to option B."}

So, the situation implies that Han Meimei is expected to look in the cabinet as the sweatshirt was last at that place for her.\n\n[[D]], The answer is: [[D]].\nYou are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Two of her family members wanted to ride the Ferris wheel, which costs 4 tickets per ride, three wanted to ride the carousel, which costs 2 tickets per ride, and the remaining three wanted to ride the roller coaster which costs 5 tickets per ride. If Elisa brought 50 tickets, how many tickets will she have left after everyone has ridden their chosen rides?\nLet's think first. Chain of thought:\n1. Determine how many tickets are needed for each ride:\n   a. Ferris wheel: 2 family members * 4 tickets per ride = 8 tickets\n   b. Carousel: 3 family members * 2 tickets per ride = 6 tickets\n   c. Roller coaster: 3 family members * 5 tickets per ride = 15 tickets\n\n2. Add up the total number of tickets needed for all the rides:\n   Total tickets needed = 8 (Ferris wheel) + 6 (Carousel) + 15 (Roller coaster)\n   Total tickets needed = 29 tickets\n\n3. Compare the total number of tickets needed to the number of tickets Elisa brought:\n   Elisa has 50 tickets, and she needs 29 tickets for everyone to ride their chosen rides.\n\n4. Calculate the remaining number of tickets Elisa will have after everyone has ridden their chosen rides:\n   Remaining tickets = 50 (Elisa's tickets) - 29 (tickets needed for rides)\n   Remaining tickets = 21 tickets\n\nSo, after everyone has ridden their chosen rides, Elisa will have 21 tickets left.\n\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information.

If they had $60 for the dinner and movie, how much money do they have left after they go to the movie?\nLet's think first. Chain of thought:\n1. First, calculate the total cost for the meals: 2 meals * $10 each = $20\n2. Next, calculate the total cost for the movie tickets: 2 tickets * $11 each = $22\n3. Add the total costs for the meals and the movies: $20 (meals) + $22 (movies) = $42\n4. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money they had: $60 - $42 = $18\n\nSo, after going to the movie, Elisa and her boyfriend have $18 left.\n\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information.

In a small bowl, combine corn starch and 2 tablespoons of water; stir into meat mixture. Place 1 wrapper on a work surface. Moisten edges of wrapper with water. Place about 2 tablespoons of meat mixture on center of wrapper. Fold sides of wrapper over meat; roll up wrapper, tucking in ends as you roll. Heat a teaspoon of oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the egg rolls and cook for 5 minutes per side, or until golden brown. In a small bowl (or in a jar with lid), whisk together the ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, sriracha, garlic powder, corn starch and 1/4 cup water (or 1/4 cup chicken stock). Pour mixture into skillet with egg rolls, stirring constantly until bubbly and thickened. Serve egg rolls with sauce for dipping. , Moistening the edges of the egg roll wrapper helps to seal it while you're rolling and prevents it from cracking. , You can freeze the egg roll pasta to keep on hand for quick egg roll meals. You can form the egg rolls and then freeze them for later use. , These egg rolls are different from others because they are cooked in a skillet instead of being fried., What does my mother-in-law love?

They use reconnaissance units to spy on their enemy's actions. This indicates that they are gathering information to better understand their enemy's strategies and plans.\n3. The question asks what Bingwa wants when he spies on Pango. Based on the information provided, Bingwa is likely trying to gain an advantage over Pango by learning about Pango's actions.\n4. Analyzing the answer options, I have found that:\n\nA. Pango's battle plan - This aligns with the purpose of spying on an enemy; to understand their strategies and plans.\nB. Pango's mace - This seems like an unrelated item to the context provided.\nC. Pango's territory - While sying on the enemy could potentially provide information about their territory, this option doesn't directly answer what Bingwa wants.\nD. Pango's warship - This also seems like an unrelated item to the context provided.\n\nBased on step 1-4 analysis, I infer that the most likely answer is:\n[[A]]\n\nUser: \nA man jumped in his car, and drove to his workplace.\n\nAfter examining the story provided, we can see that the man is currently in driving to his workplace. We cannot determine the concept that the man is best described as.\n\n(A, B, C, or D)\n\nA, B, C, and D appear in the graphic design in the question's original appearance but is not part of the story or context. It seems that the answer choices aren't connected to the context provided.\n\nAs a result, I'm going to randomly output one of the answer options, as there is not enough information to choose an answer based on the story:\n[[A]]"}
